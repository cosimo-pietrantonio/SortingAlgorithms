# Sorting algorithms
The aim of this repository is to describe and implement some of the most famous sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble sort algorithm
2. Merge sort algorithm
3. Quick sort algorithm

In order to provide a comprehensive explanation, this README reviews all alortihm emphasizing the pros and cons of each.

## Bubble sort
Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
The bubble sort algorithm follows a simple, step-by-step process. Starting at the beginning of the list, it compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are sorted incorrectly. This process continues iteratively until the entire list is sorted. During each iteration, the greatest unsorted element gradually "bubbles" toward the end of the list.
